Here are some of my projects. Feel free to check them out!

- **[Melod](https://github.com/GIsaacLN/Melod)**: A SwiftUI-based iOS app that suggests songs to add to a playlist using a custom CoreML model. Inspired by Spotify, it allows users to manage a playlist by adding or deleting songs, with the model recommending new tracks based on the playlist's existing songs.
