# Hi there, I'm Isaac! üëã 

I'm a software developer currently studying applied mathematics and computer science. I'm passionate about problem-solving, creating efficient solutions, and learning new technologies. My curiosity drives me to dive deep into the world of algorithms and data structures.

- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Databases: MySQL, MariaDB
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker
- Familiar: AWS, Google Cloud

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects 

Here are some of my projects. Feel free to check them out!

- **[Vida Loca Travel](https://gisaacln.github.io/VidaLocaTravel/)**: This project is a dynamic website for a fictitious travel agency, crafted as part of a school assignment. The site showcases available travel destinations and packages, providing an immersive experience for potential travelers. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP with MySQL for the backend. A local WAMP server was used for development and testing.
- **[NutriScan](#)**: NutriScan is an iOS app that empowers users to make healthier food choices by providing detailed nutritional information at a glance. The app leverages advanced technologies like CoreML and VisionKit to scan and analyze food items. After scanning, users can register the foods they've eaten for later analysis. My main contribution was in the backend development, where I used SwiftUI, Python, and Flask to build a robust API for retrieving nutritional info. CoreData was also used for local data persistence.
- **[Digame](#)**: Digame is an ambitious prototype for an app designed to serve as a sign language interpreter. The current version presents a well-designed user interface, built with SwiftUI, demonstrating the intended functionality. The ultimate goal for Digame is to incorporate AI technologies to stitch together sign language videos into cohesive, long-form sentences, providing a much-needed communication tool for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
